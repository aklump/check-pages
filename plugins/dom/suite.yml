    -
      dom: h1.page-title

      why: Capture the timestamp to use in the next assertion.
      dom: .page-title
      attribute: data-timestamp
      matches: /.+/
      set: currentTime
    -
      why: Assert the timestamp in the data attribute matches the subtitle; because the value is dynamic and always changing, the only way to assert against it is to use the set property.
      dom: h2.page-subtitle
      matches: /${currentTime}$/

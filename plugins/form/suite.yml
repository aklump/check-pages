-
  why: Demonstrate the simplest Form plugin syntax.
  url: /test_subject.php
  form:
    dom: .form-a
  find:
    -
      dom: .messages
      text: Form A Was Submitted

-
  why: Demonstrate using the submit property to choose the button.
  url: /test_subject.php
  form:
    dom: .form-b
    submit: '.form-save'
  find:
    -
      dom: .messages
      text: Save Was Used to Submit

-
  why: Demonstrate using the submit property to choose a different button.
  url: /test_subject.php
  form:
    dom: .form-b
    submit: '.form-delete'
  find:
    -
      dom: .messages
      text: Delete Was Used to Submit

-
  why: Demonstrate posting values.
  url: /test_subject.php
  form:
    dom: .form-b
    input:
      -
        name: message
        value: A Little Extra Message
      -
        why: This is not in the form, but it can still be provided without a test error.
        name: first_name
        value: Frank
  find:
    -
      dom: .messages
      text: A Little Extra Message

-
  why: Demonstrate how a Drupal form can be submitted w/hidden fields.
  url: /test_subject.php
  form:
    dom: .drupal-form
    input:
      -
        name: field_amount[0][value]
        value: $19.99

    # This is optional, but may help with readability.
    submit: '#edit-submit'

  find:
    -
      why: Assert the new value $19.99 is received by the form handler.
      dom: .messages
      is: $19.99

  why: Assert javascript is run after the redirect.
  visit: /test_subject.php?redirect
  expect: 302

  visit: /test_subject.php
  js: true

      why: Test we can eval JS without asserting anything.
      javascript: document.querySelector('body').classList.add('foo')

  why: This example shows how to check the window location hash by using the javascript selector.  It also checks that js is set to true automatically.
  visit: /test_subject.php
  find:
    -
      javascript: location.hash
      matches: /^#foo=bar&alpha=bravo$/
    -
      javascript: location.hash
      is: '#foo=bar&alpha=bravo'
    -
      javascript: location.hash
      is not: '#foo=bar&alpha=bravo&charlie=delta'
    -
      javascript: location.query
      is: ""

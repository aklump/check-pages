## Plugins & Testing

Do not edit the following, as they are created in the build step and will be
overwritten. To affect these files you need to look to _plugins/_
directory, which contains the source code.

```
.
├── tests
│     ├── plugins
│     │     ├── foo.yml
│     │     └── javascript.yml
│     ├── runner_plugins.php
└── web
    └── plugins
        ├── foo.html
        └── javascript.html

```

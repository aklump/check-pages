# JSON Pointer

Implements [JSON Pointer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901) to be able to extract data from JSON responses.

Features:

* Will only work on valid JSON responses. A valid response is one that explicitly has `content-type: application/json` whose body can be parsed as JSON without error.
